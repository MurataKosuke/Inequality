# ineqchain.v

An prototype of a tactic library for chain notation for equalities and inequalities on nat.

## OVERVIEW

- `ineqchain.v`: An prototype of tactic library.
- `sample.v`: An example of proofs using this tactic library for inequality `forall (n : nat), 5 <= n -> 2^(n+1) <= n!.`.
- `ack.v`: An example of proofs using this tactic library for properties of Ackermann function.
